//Notes - - - Youtube Video
  //so it looks like we are doing everything inside the function component App(),
  //the actual javascript code is at the top of the function component, before the return



  //Hooks 
  //you can only use hooks inside of function components! Not a class
  //hooks must execute in the same order
  //react will catch errors if use state are in
       // ....if statement, functions like regular functions
  //useState hook should be at the top level of the function component before the return 

  //useState always give us back an array with two values (line 6). The first one is your current state, second one...
     //is a function that will update the state when called
  
  //so whenever we call our useState, aka our update function, its going to re-render our component, with the new value of our count

  //when you update the state the component re-renders the whole thing

  //you can also inside of your use state, line 6, you can call a function, and object, and probably everything else

  //you can add more then one use State, line 7
    //makes things easier if you have more states, doing a certain thing 
    //in this case adding the text "More Donuts", "Less Donuts"
